# refunc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheLudd/refunc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheLudd/refunc)

A very small, and thus very powerful functional reactive programming library.

Versions lower than `0.1.0` are considered experimental. I try them out myself in real world applications and add what is needed step by step. I invite you to do the same if you'd like.
For documentation look at the code where many functions are documented.

### Disclaimer
I have no idea what FRP actually is, I only know somewhat what I would like it to be and existing toturials out there keep
dissapointing me.
